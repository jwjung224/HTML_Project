		 Search engines use automated software (known as robots or spiders) to follow links on Websites, harvesting information as they go. 
		 When someone submits a query to a search engine, the engine returns a list of sites, ranking them on their relevance to the keywords used in the search.
		 How search engines assess your site and determine the relevance of the words often depends on how the specific search engine works. 
		 Some engines, such as Excite, use artificial intelligence to recognize concepts that frequently appear together. 
		 Other search engines, list the more popular sites first. 
		 There is no way to guarantee that your site will come up on top in a search.
		</li>
		<li>
		 meta tag is a special HTML tag that is used to store information about a Web page but is not displayed in a Web browser. 
		 For example, meta tags provide information such as what program was used to create the page, a description of the page,
		 and keywords that are relevant to the page. Many search engines use the information stored in meta tags when they index Web pages.
		 The meta description should employ the keywords intelligently, but also create a compelling description that a searcher will want to click.
		 Direct relevance to the page and uniqueness between each page’s meta description is key. 
		 The description should optimally be between 150-160 characters.
		 Even though, the description meta tags have no effect on search engine rank such as google.com, they do appear in search results. 
		 This means that a person gets to read your description on a search results page before clicking on your link, 
		 showing that meta descriptions should be written for people to read rather than for robots to find. So while a good meta description will not improve your ranking, 
		 it will increase click-through rates to your website from search pages.
