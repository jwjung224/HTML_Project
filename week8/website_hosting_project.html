 <h2 class="bodyContextH2"> What does a host do? </h2>
 <ul class="navRoman">
	<li> 
	 What is a web server? Why would you need one? Explain why getting a domain name is not enough to put your site up on the web. 
	</li>
	<li> 
	 What service does a website hosting company provide? What are the most important characteristics to look for in selecting a good web hosting company?

		<li>
		 Web servers are computers that deliver (serves up) Web pages. Every Web server has an IP address and possibly a domain name. 
		Any computer can be turned into a Web server by installing server software and connecting the machine to the Internet 
		I need web server because I need some place to store my information. 
		Just getting domain name is just having street address; in order to place to stay, I need a house. 
		Thus, web server stores all the information that I want to store and domain name leads other people to access to my information which I stored in web server. 
		</li>
		<li>
		 These are the registration of domain names (see below) and provision of email. 
		They may also provide technical support either through their web sites or by email or telephone.
		Reliability and stability are couple of the most important qualities that the hosting company can offer its clients. 
		Essentially, which means the hosting company won't take on more consumers and websites of computer can manage considering the number of servers, staff members and equipment accessible. 
		The most credible as well as successful hosting websites will maintain dedicated servers along with refrain from overloading the particular bandwidth 
		and storage space to ensure that equipment and methods are less likely for you to crash and intensive traffic to your website may be accommodated.

 <h2 class="bodyContextH2"> Research hosting plans </h2>
 <ul class="navRoman">
	<li> 
	 Research companies that provide website hosting plans. On average, what is the price range (price per month) for hosting a website? What are the most important features for you when reviewing a hosting plan? 
	</li>
	<li> 
	 After checking several hosting reviews, create a table of your most important features. 
	</li>
	<li> 
	 Visit the website for at least three hosting companies and compare at least two different hosting plans and their prices from each. 
	</li>
	<li> 
	 Identify one of the companies and hosting plans as the best value for the price. 
	</li>
 </ul>
 
 <section class="bodyContextWeek" >

	<ul class="navRoman">
		<li>
		 It is about $5 to $10 a month. I can get cheaper price, if I get longer term. 
		I think company’s reliability is the most important for me 
		because I want to sustain my web page as long as I want with no trouble.
