	<ul>
		<li>Each part of the domain name provides specific information. These pieces of information enable web browsers to locate the web page.
		The naming system is closely regulated in order to prevent confusion or duplicate addresses. 
		</li>
		<li> Domain name is important because it represent my website. My domain name is my address or location on the internet.
		It's also your name and identity which means a bad name could cause people to come to your site and leave or never come to your website at all. 
		</li>
		<li>
		It has to be unique so people can remember to revisit and find it easy.
		</li>
		<li>
		Registering domain name is one of procedure in order to create website. 
		It is a good metaphor that I am renting space in building and building can be .com, .net, .org, etc…
		</li>		
		<li>
		Term register in domain name is I will be the owner of that register name as long as I manage to have them. 
		If my domain name is already taken in that network – for example, .com - , I can find another network with same name such as .net, .info, .org, etc…

 	<h2 class="bodyContextH2"> How to get your own name </h2>
 <section class="bodyContextWeek" >

	<ul>
		<li> I found some websites that offers 1 dollar and 2 dollars per year. 
		However, it is average about $10 to $20 per year to register and get my domain name in general. 
		Price does not change a lot even if I pay 10 years in advance.
		This works like renting office space so I can keep the domain name as long as I pay annual fees to host.
		</li>
		<li> For my own personal webpage domain names, I tried finalfantasyworld.com jjfinalfantay.com, and worldoffinalfantasy.com. 
		First one was already taken but second and third one was available.
		</li>
