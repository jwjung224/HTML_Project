		<li>
		Web site topic / title of the site: Information about video game final fantasy 13/ World of Final Fantasy. 
		</li>
		<li> 
		Target Audience : Age 10 to 40, people who are already fan of previous Final Fantasy series or interested in Role Playing Game. 
		</li>
		<li>
		Purpose of the Site: This is informative site about Final Fantasy series precisely 13. 
		It will have brief history about what Final Fantasy is and information of Final Fantasy 13.
		</li>
		<li>
		Main features of the Site: About what is Final Fantasy, history, series feature, sub categories include characters, story line. Q & A, Screen shots.
		</li>		
		<li>
		Personality: Passion, Enthusiasm, get something you did not know before if you did not know about final fantasy.
		</li>
		<li>
		Limiting Factors: Generally age between 10 to 40 are very familiar with internet atmosphere 
		so if they were wondering what Final Fantasy is then, this site would be maybe getting start information about that game.
		For those of who already fan maybe share their opinions and ask what they are feel or how they did it when they play it. 
		No bragging, No insulting, friendly atmosphere to get information. I would expect them to use any browsers since most of them well know with internet.
		Internet speed would not be matter since I will try to avoid design the site very complicated.
