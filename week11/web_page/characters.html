		<li class="charImages"><img src="../images/FFXIII_character_Lightning.png" width="120" height="200" alt="Lightning">
		</li>
		<li class="charText">
		*LIGHTING* <br /> Lightning and her sister Sarah were orphaned as small children. It was then that she took the name Lightning. To her it seemed like it was fitting for a new life. She has given up her post as a member of the Guardian Core, in order to help save her sister from being taken by the Fal'Cie. She joins the Purge, in the hopes of finding her again.
		</li>
		<li class="charImages"><img src="../images/FFXIII_character_Snow.png" width="120" height="200" alt="Snow">
		</li>
		<li class="charText">
		*SNOW* <br /> Snow is a irrepressible fiery guy, who loves nothing more than to dive head first into danger. Not one to think through he lets his power do all the work. Snow is the leader of Team Nora, who are set to defend Cocoon. This band of young teens has infiltrated the Hanging Edge, in the hopes of stopping the Fal'Cie. Snow also seeks to save his fiance Sarah, Lightning's sister, from the hold of the Fal'Cie. Though he is swayed easily by his emotions, people are drawn to his irresistible charm and outgoing nature.
		</li>
		<li class="charImages"><img src="../images/FFXIII_character_Sazh.png" width="130" height="220" alt="Sazh">
		</li>
		<li class="charText">
		*SAZH* <br />Sazh is a very quiet gentle man, who travels with his Chocobo Chick companion. Sazh is quick to banter, but keeps with the mature perspective on the situation at hand. His son, Dajh was taken by the Cocoon Fal'Cie, and he has the intentions of finding him again. Little does he know the path he is taking will lead him to the one responsible for his son becoming a Fal'Cie.		
		</li>
		<li class="charImages"><img src="../images/FFXIII_character_Hope.png" width="140" height="200" alt="Hope">
		</li>
		<li class="charText">
		*HOPE* <br />Hope would be best described as a average normal boy, living in Cocoon. The advent of the Pulse Fal'Cie has thrown his life into complete turmoil, and he has no idea of what is going on or what to do. The loss of his mother during the purge has made him want revenge. Will he really go that path, or will going with Lightning and the others show him how to truly live?
		</li>
		<li class="charImages"><img src="../images/FFXIII_character_Vanille.png" width="120" height="200" alt="Vanille">
		</li>
		<li class="charText">
		*Vanille* <br />Oebra is a bright, sunny person. She has autumn hair bunched in pigtails, and wears a bright pink outfit to match her persona. Her history is completely unknown to anyone, even to her she says. But it would seem that there is something hidden within the heart of this outwardly cheerful young woman.
		</li>
		<li class="charImages"><img src="../images/FFXIII_character_Fang.png" width="180" height="200" alt="Fang">
		</li>
		<li class="charText">
		*FANG* <br />Fang is mysterious in every way. She is aiding the Sanctum Military, though she herself bears the mark of the La'Cie. No one knows where she came from, or why she is there. She is secretly looking for someone very important to her, as well as trying to regain her lost memories. No one can be certain of the true power within this strong-minded woman.
