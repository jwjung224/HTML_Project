	<h2> What is Final Fantasy? </h2>
 	<p> Final Fantasy is a popular series of role-playing games produced by <a href="http://na.square-enix.com/us/home">Square Enix (originally Square Co., Ltd.).</a> 
	It may be the most widely distributed game series of all time, including both standard console games and portable games, 
	two massively multiplayer online role-playing games, games for mobile phones, two CGI films (one being original, the other being being a sequel to Final Fantasy VII), and two anime series.
	The first installment of the series premiered in Japan in 1987, and Final Fantasy games have subsequently been localized for markets in North America, Europe and Australia,
	on several modern video game consoles, including the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Game Boy, the MSX 2, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the Sony PlayStation, the PC, the WonderSwan Color,
	the Sony PlayStation 2, IBM PC compatible,Game Boy Advance, Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation Portable, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Nintendo DS, as well as several different models of mobile phones. 
	It is Square Enix's most successful franchise, having sold over 100 million units worldwide as of June 7, 2011.
	As of 2012, fourteen games have been released as part of the main (numbered) series, but in total the Final Fantasy series includes numerous spin-offs, sequels, and subseries.
	It currently ranks as the second-best selling RPG series ever, and the eighth-best selling video game series in the world.
